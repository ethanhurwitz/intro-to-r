</h2>
<p>Whether in academia, industry, or clinical settings, if you are interested in social sciences or data science, you are going to have to work with data. You’ll be using that data to perform analyses, make visualizations, and try to answer questions. Using programming languages and coding-based approaches are increasingly favored over GUI-based approaches (e.g., Excel, JMP, SPSS, etc.). The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to one such programming language, R.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-objectives" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Course Objectives<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#course-objectives"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There are 3 main sections of content in this course:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>R Basics</li>
<li>Data Manipulation and Cleaning</li>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
</ol>
<p>Along the way, you will learn how to use R to …</p>
<ul>
<li>Import data for cleaning</li>
<li>Wrangle and Prep data for analyzing</li>
<li>Make publication-ready visualizations</li>
</ul>
<p>Communicate what you have learned about your data …</p>
<ul>
<li>In literate programming documents</li>
<li>In an APA formatted written report</li>
</ul>
<p>Contribute to open and reproducible science through …</p>
<ul>
<li>Adopting good coding and project management practices</li>
<li>Sharing your data and research reports online</li>
</ul>
<p>This course is designed such that, by the end, you will be able to use R to successfully accomplish all the basic tasks you’ll have to do in other classes or lab volunteering. Content was chosen specifically based on what other students have mentioned they do most often.</p>

<p>While the official schedule of classes specifies separate “lecture” and “lab” sessions for the course, do not take this distinction too seriously. “Lecture” sessions will not consist exclusively of traditional lecture, and “lab” sessions will not consist exclusively of traditional guided laboratory exercises. On any given day, you are likely to encounter some mix of brief lecture, group discussion, and/or hands-on activities.</p>

<p>All course materials are free. You have enough expenses, I am not interested in adding to them unnecessarily.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Computer with R and RStudio</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is a programming course, it would be hard to get by without a computer! You will need to download R and RStudio.</li>
<li>You can download R <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">here</a>.</li>
<li>You can download RStudio <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>. You <u>must</u> download R <strong>before</strong> RStudio.</li>
<li>You can find a quick tutorial about getting R ready on your computer <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~gulzar/rstudio/index.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Website</strong>
<ul>
<li>You’re looking at it right now! This website will be the main hub for course-related material. This is where I will be uploading lecture notes, information about assignments, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Canvas</strong>
<ul>
<li>Canvas will be used for posting grades. That’s pretty much it!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- * **[DataHub](https://datahub.ucsd.edu/hub/login)** --><!--   + Most of the R-based assignments will be completed through Jupyter notebooks on the UCSD  --><!-- DataHub website. --><ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="">Discord</a></strong>
<ul>
<li>We’ll use Discord as a central place to manage questions about the class, communicate with each other, and easily copy/paste code for sharing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="https://ucsd.zoom.us/my/ethanhurwitz">Zoom</a></strong>

</h3>
<p>This class has <strong>NO EXAMS</strong>. Yes, that is right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time constrained coding is not reflective of most real-world scenarios (at least those you’ll initially find yourselves in).</li>
<li>Exams would not do a good job of assessing whether you are learning what I want you to learn.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there must be <strong><em>some</em></strong> things to grade you on. They are the following:</p>
<p><strong>Attendance Activities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These are practice exercises done in class that apply the concepts/material I am introducing.
<ul>
<li>Forces you to participate and provides some grade buffer with easy points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(Weekly) Practice Question Sets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These will be similar in format to the practice exercises done in class, but will be done on your own.
<ul>
<li>Provides you an opportunity to practice applying new skills and ideas on your own, but still in a directed, hand hold-y, way.</li>
<li>There will often be time to work on these in class.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skills Challenges (3x)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There will be one skills challenge for each of the 3 main sections of content covered in this course.
<ul>
<li>Skills challenges will be similar to the practice question sets but use different data.</li>
<li>They will also have some questions that are more abstract/conceptual, and require you really thinking about the data you’re working with (similar to what you will be doing outside of this class).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Project</strong></p>
<p>You will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a dataset from a provided list of options and come up with a few research questions you can answer with that data.</li>
<li>Include a brief literature review to provide sources which help justify and provide rationale for your hypothesized answers to those questions.</li>
<li>Clean/change/modify/whatever the data to get it in a form where it can answer those questions, and create visualizations and summary statistics that demonstrate those answers.
<ul>
<li>This will be reminiscent of what a Results section would look like from a peer-reviewed journal article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The paper will largely just be explaining what you’ve done.
<ul>
<li>What does the data contain?</li>
<li>What are your questions?</li>
<li>What are the possible answers?</li>
<li>What are your predictions and why?</li>
<li>What would you expect to see if your predictions are accurate? If they are not accurate?</li>
<li>What did you do (explain your code in words)?</li>
<li>Show the visualizations and summary statistics and explain/interpret them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The other thing you will do is create a literate programming document for your project. We will expound on this more later, but the code document you create will be thoroughly annotated for others’ understanding.</li>

<p>This course is designed to facilitate your engagement and effort with the material. What is going to help you learn and develop R skills the most is to actually <strong>practice doing</strong> coding, a lot. It is thus, in my view, counter-productive to have a single heavily weighted assignment (exam). The full grade breakdown is as follows:</p>

<p>Grades will be rounded to the nearest hundredth of a point and the stated letter grade cutoffs will be applied without exception. There is no plan to “curve” grades in this course. Your instructor reserves the right to adjust all students’ grades up by a set value if deemed appropriate, and grades will not be adjusted down under any circumstances.</p>
<p>To earn an A+ in this course, you must do work of truly outstanding quality. A+ grades will be awarded at my discretion (there is no set grade percentage to earn this grade).</p>

<p>All students are expected to adhere to standards of academic integrity. Cheating of any kind on any assignment will not be tolerated. It is disrespectful to your peers, the university, and to me. Especially considering this course is designed with a grading scheme that rewards effort and engagement and does not disproportionately favor correctness.</p>
<p>If you are unsure what might constitute a violation of academic integrity, consult me and/or the <a href="http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu">UCSD website on academic integrity</a>. Any evidence of academic misconduct will be reported to the Academic Integrity Office. Consequences for academic misconduct may include a failing grade in the course and official action by the University. <u><strong>Please, do not make me have to do this.</strong></u> If you are struggling with the course content or anything else, <strong>reach out to me</strong>.</p>

<p>Attendance is <u>strongly encouraged</u>, and the decision to hold the course remotely was made in order to maximize the ability for students to attend synchronously, but is not required. Participation is based on activity completion, which can be completed asynchronously. HOWEVER, it is much more difficult to do so alone, and we will often go over the answers in class.</p>

<p>Most assignments have due dates that give you a fair amount of time to complete them. Granted, it is a Summer Session course, so things move at an accelerated pace. That said, I am a pretty reasonable person and will grant extensions under <em>reasonable</em> circumstances (being stressed will not warrant an extension).

<p>You may earn up to 2 points of extra credit which will be added to your overall grade in the course. One of those points can be earned by completing SONA participation credits (worth 0.5 points each). To sign up for an experiment, go to the <a href="https://ucsd.sona-systems.com">SONA website</a>. To earn the full point of extra credit in the class, you must complete 2 SONA credits.</p>
<p>The second extra credit point can be earned by completing the CAPEs for our course as well as an additional survey sent out at the end of the quarter. If 80% of the class completes both surveys, the entire class will earn 1 extra credit point.</p>

<p>This is a brand new course, and the first time it is being offered. When designing a new course, there is a lot of content you could potentially cover!</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="figures/courseDevelopment.jpeg" style="width:100.0%"></div>
<p>In choosing what content to include, this was my philosophy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I wanted to spend more time practicing a few skills so they could be deeply learned, rather than cover a broader array of material with less depth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Focusing on a narrower amount of content affords more practice time with that content and better learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>I decided to focus on the skills and things you are most likely to be applying soon after this class</p></li>
<li>
<p>I spoke with students who have come out of my other R classes, asked them:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What do they do/use most often?</li>
<li>What do they wish they had learned?</li>
<li>Showed them some things I considered including and asked if they thought it would have been helpful.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>The answers to these questions helped me determine what content to include in this class.</p></li>
<li>
<p>I am always happy to chat about things outside the scope of course content! In office hours or email/discord/whatever.</p>
<p><!-- - Brief overview of what we’ll cover -->
<!-- - Philosophy / reasoning on why and how I’ve chosen what I’ve chosen. -->
<!--    - Want to spend more time practicing a few things to deeply learn them rather than cover a broader array of material with less depth -->
<!--    - Decided to focus on the skills and things you are most likely to be applying soon after this class -->
<!--    - Talked with students who have come out of my other R classes, asked them 1. What do they do/use most often, 2. What do they wish they had learned, 3. Showed them some things I considered including and asked if they thought it would have been helpful. -->
<!--    - Whereas most Social Psychology courses involve material that requires declarative knowledge, or the knowledge about facts, this course requires procedural knowledge. Learning programming is like learning a language, because it literally **is** learning a language. When you're learning to drive, you can't just read about different driving tips and best practices, you have to actually go out and get behind a wheel and practice. It requires procedural knowledge. With that in mind, focusing on a narrower amount of content affords more practice with that content and better learning. -->

<p>Learning a new language, particularly a programming language, can be frustrating at times!</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="figures/r_rollercoaster.png" style="width:100.0%"></div>
<p>It is truly a roller coaster. With time, effort, and perseverance,<!-- and maybe some wine/Beyoncè playlists,--> you will be surprised at how much you know and are able to do (and how much <em>more</em> you can learn and do)!</p>
