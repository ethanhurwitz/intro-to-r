# 1. Create your own graph using the `penguins` data and pick 2 of the following to put on your x and y axes: `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, or `body_mass_g`.

```{r}

```


# 2. Update your graph above by telling ggplot you want it to render a point for each observation in the penguins dataset. Describe the pattern/relationship you see.

```{r}

```


# 3. Think about what patterns you notice in the visualization you created, and test whether `sex` or `species` might explain those patterns. Make a prediction, test that prediction, and then describe what you see.

```{r}

```

# 4. Add in the line of best fit with `geom_smooth()`, making sure that your code produces a single line that is fit to ***all*** your data.

```{r}

```

# 5. Use R code to recreate the graphs below

# 6. 
## Part 1: Take the code you produced for Exercise 4 and 1. Change the shape to be solid color squares mapped to the `species` variable. 2. Change the shape to be hollow squares mapped to the `species` variable. 3. Change the shape to be filled squares mapped to the `species` variable, and fill with a color of your choosing.

## Part 2: Use R code to recreate the graphs below

```{r}

```

# Bonus Challenge. See if you can think of a way to use what we demonstrated above to take your code from the Exercise 6, part 2, question 3, and give each observation a thicker outside border.

```{r}

```

# 7. Update the main graph you have been working with throughout the exercises to make the observations more translucent. First try doing so by mapping it to `island`. Then, create another graph where you set the alpha yourself. Try to pick the value you think makes the graph most legible and effective.

```{r}
