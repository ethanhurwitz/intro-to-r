```


# 2. Use each of the following operators in a new expression:

"<"
">"
"<="
">="
"=="
"!="

```{r exercise 2}
# Your code here
```


# 3. Use each of the operators below in a new expression. Also, use each operator combined with at least one other operator.

"&"
"|"
"!"

```{r exercise 3}
# Your code here
```


# 4. Define variables of each of the previous types. Use `typeof()` to verify the type.

```{r exercise 4}
# Your code here
```


# 5. Create 4 vectors that each contain a different type of data. See which operations can be applied to each vector.

```{r exercise 5}
# Your code here
```

# 6. Index the first, middle, and last, element from each of the vectors you defined above. Save the first element from your first vector to a variable called `first_first`, and the last element from your last vector to one called `last_last`.


```{r exercise 6}
# Your code here
```


# 7. Create a dataframe that has information about your top 3 favorite animals. It should contain 3 columns: 1. That has the words, "first", "second", and "third". 2. That has the animals names. 3. That has a rating, on a scale of 1-10, of how likely you think it is you could beat that animal in a fight to the death.

```{r exercise 7}
# Your code here
```


# 8. Index the second row of your dataframe and save it to a variable called `df_second_row`. Index the name of your second favorite animal and save it to a variable called `second_fave`. Index the battle likelihood rating for your third favorite animal and save it to a variable called `third_rating`.

```{r exercise 8}
# Your code here
```
