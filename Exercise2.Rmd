# 1. Decide where you want your R and class files to live on your computer. Create a new project called "my_first_project" in that location. Open the .Rproj file and create and save a new RMarkdown file titled "notes".

# 2. Use `here()` to find the file path to your R Project and copy/paste it to the cell below. What would the `here()` command be to create the file path do your "notes" document? Include that below as well!

```{r exercise 2}
# Your code here
```


# 3. Create a new code chunk below. Name the code chunk "exercise 3", and copy/paste your file path from above.




# 4. First, decide on a coding convention to use. Then, create a new code chunk named "coding convention". In it, save the name of your chosen coding convention as a string to a variable called "coding convention" that is formatted with that coding convention. For example, if you are going to use snake case, it would be called `coding_convention`.





# 5. Clean up all the code below so that it follows the proper formatting guidlines listed above.

```{r exercise 5}
df[,4]
df[ ,2]
df[ , 0]

mean (df$col, na.rm = TRUE)
mean( df$col, na.rm = TRUE )

3+4+5
-2*8^2
#computer persons height
height<-feet*12+inches
T+1<2
!F|F+1

long_computation('little',bunny=1,foo*2,hopping,through='forest')

```
